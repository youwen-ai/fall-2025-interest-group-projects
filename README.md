## Contributing

Feel free to contribute your own work to this project.
Create a new directory under `user/` with a unique handle (e.g. github handle or gatech email prefix) and add your code there.
This helps keep the codebase organized and avoids headaches with merge conflicts for those with weaker git skills.
